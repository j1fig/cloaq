cloaq
=====

A command line utility for interacting with Open Air Quality data.


*DO NOT USE* this is still very immature and in alpha. use at your own risk, breaking changes will still surely occur.

## Features

None so far.

## Known issues


## Roadmap

1. get something very basic going and establish and initially working end-user delivery pipeline.
    * use GH releases.
    * plain manual install instructions for MacOSX/Linux only.
2. lazy creation of $HOME/.cloaq dir structure.
3. have config from $HOME/.cloaq/config (YAML).
4. smart http caching under $HOME/.cloaq/http-cache (have TTL's per HTTP resource in config, with nice defaults).

## Distribution

In proper production an upload script and a curl -so command that downloads that script and pipes it to a bash. 
The script itself can be autogenerated for each version, and gets the right binary for that version (see how Google k8s tooling does it).

Meanwhile setup by:

1. Download your platform version from the releases.
2. chmod +x cloaq
3. sudo mv cloaq /usr/local/bin

##### TODO Windows instructions - shouldn't be too hard though.
